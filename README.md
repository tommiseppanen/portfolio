# Tommi's Portfolio
A web page that lists my hobby programming projects. Uses React for user interface components, ES6 features for data fetching and Webpack for bundling.

Scripts:
* "npm run build" bundles files to build folder
* "npm run start" starts webpack-dev-server for development
* "npm run deploy" builds and deploys the site using gh-pages
